            ### Clinical Intelligence System
            This is a sophisticated, multi-agent framework designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing quick and accurate answers to a wide range of clinical, technical, and research-related queries.
            
            At its core is an **Orchestrator** that intelligently analyzes a user's natural language query. It identifies the user's intent and routes the request to one or more specialized agents, each with a distinct area of expertise. If multiple agents are needed, the orchestrator consolidates their findings into a single, coherent response.

            ### The Specialized Agents
            The system's power comes from its team of specialized agents:
            
            * **Nurse Agent üìà:** The frontline expert for real-time patient data. It handles queries about vital signs (like HR trends), analyzes patient deterioration using the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and can retrieve specific data like ECG waveforms.
            * **EMR Agent üìÇ:** The digital records clerk. It connects to the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system to retrieve historical patient documents, such as past discharge summaries, lab results, or radiology reports.
            * **RAG Agent üìÑ:** The go-to expert for information contained within specific documents. Users can upload PDFs (like technical manuals or device specifications), and this agent will search that private knowledge base to answer questions.
            * **Web Agent üåê:** For the most up-to-date, external information, the Web Agent is dispatched. It scrapes public websites (like PubMed or Mayo Clinic) to answer questions about the latest research or news.
            * **MedAgent üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è:** The general medical consultant. It uses a specialized, medically-trained LLM (like Meditron) to answer complex medical questions, explain clinical guidelines, or tackle USMLE-style problems.
